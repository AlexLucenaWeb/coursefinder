# CourseFinder

##CourseFinder is an application written by Alejandro Lucena, Carla Lewis and Anna Burkat as a part of Web App Development course. 
##The main aim of our project was to provide users with a platform where they could search for courses that would enable them to develop new skills.

##We build our application using nodejs and express as well as pug.
